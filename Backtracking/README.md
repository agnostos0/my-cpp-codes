# 🔁 Backtracking – Core Concept

Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithm used in recursion-heavy tasks like solving puzzles, permutations, and constraint satisfaction problems.

## 🧠 Essence of Backtracking

1. **You set a value.**
2. **Try to solve the next step.**
3. **If it fails** (i.e., the recursive call returns `false`), **you undo (backtrack)** and try the next available option.

This process continues until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

## 📌 Example Use Cases
- N-Queens Problem
- Sudoku Solver
- Maze Solving
- Permutations and Combinations
